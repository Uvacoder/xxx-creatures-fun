### Bug reports

If you find a bug in the project, please refer to the
[Issues page](https://github.com/creatures-sh/creatures.sh/issues/) to see if
the bug has already been reported. If it's not, feel free to open an issue! Make
sure to include steps to reproduce the bug, as well as the expected behavior. If
you have a suggestion for how to fix the bug, please include that as well. If
the bug is a visual bug, make sure to include a screenshot as well.

### Blog posts

If you want to write a blog post for the website, it's best to discuss it first
in the [Discord server](https://discord.creatures.sh/). We can help you with the
writing process and talk about your idea in depth. When you have a solid idea,
you can start writing the article and open a PR of your first draft.

#### Writing instructions

1. First, make sure you're on a right branch. Update the `main` branch with the
   latest changes and create a new branch named like this:
   `blog/[your-article-slug]`.

2. If you're writing for the first time, create a new file
   `src/content/authors/<your-name>.md` and add the following frontmatter
   properties to the file:

   - `username`: a string (this is your Discord username)
   - `twitter`: a string (this is your Twitter handle with the @)
   - `name`: a string (this is your name)
   - `avatar`: `'../../assets/authors/[your-username].jpg'` (make sure to add
     the image to the assets folder)

   > Feel free to check the other author files for reference.

3. Create a new `md` file in `src/content/blog` with the name of your article
   slugified (e.g. `src/content/blog/css-nesting.md`)

4. Add the following frontmatter to the file:

   - `title`: a string
   - `updateDate`: YYYY-MM-DD format string
   - `publishDate`: YYYY-MM-DD format string
   - `image`: `'featured-[X].jpg'` where X is the number of the image
   - `tags`: [] of strings
   - `author`: the slug of the author file you created in step 2
   - `excerpt`: a string

   > Feel free to check the other blog posts for reference.

5. Write your article.

#### PR instructions

1. When you're done writing, commit your changes and push them to your forked
   repo.

2. Open a PR from your forked repo to the `main` branch of the main repo.

3. Make sure to add the `blog` label to your PR.

4. Copy the PR link and post it in the
   [Discord server](https://discord.creatures.sh/) in the `#blog` channel.

5. We'll review your PR and give you feedback. If everything is good, we'll
   merge it and publish your article.

#### Cross-posting policy

Cross-posting to creatures.sh is welcomed! If you'd like to share your own
article that you published elsewhere, just add the `canonicalUrl` property in
the frontmatter of your article that points to your original blog post, wherever
it may be. Feel free to share your PR with the rest of the community in Discord
after you open it.
